# gist-monitor
to run this project:
  1. pull the development repository
  2. access the /src file
  3. run yarn/npm dev command to start the process
 
The project uses GitHup and Pipedrive APIs to access the information, node.js to manipulate data.
React.js is used for the front-end (not working)

## The project WIPs
- [ ] Need to automate dockerization and upload to google cloud with github actions or Travis ci
- [ ] figure out the storage issue to store past values of gists and compare to current
- [ ] figure out the clean UI
